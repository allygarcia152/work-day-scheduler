Users for this scheduler can click on the time block they want to schedule something for, type in their event, and click the save button for that time slot in order to save the task. Upon reload, users will find that their tasks have been saved and will not clear from their schedule. Users can also reference their schedule easily with the color coding system: grey for past hours, red for the current hour, and green for future hours.
